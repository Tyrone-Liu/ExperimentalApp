Should works great on Pixel and Nexus, or any manufacturer that doesn't do too much modifications to stock Android.

+ Android API Level >= 26 (>= 28 will have more feature)
+ Device has `android.hardware.camera2` support
+ `CameraCharacteristics.INFO_SUPPORTED_HARDWARE_LEVEL` >= `FULL` (lower capability may encounter error or crash)

Make sure to check out 'Known Bugs' section on the end of this file.

    * Both basic and special elements (except 'Time condition') have their own 'repeat count', can be endless
+ Additional Tools for Capture
    * [ ] On Screen Display (OSD) of **Elevation Angle** and **Azimuth**
    * [ ] OSD of GPS information (Longtitude, Latitude, Altitude)
    * [ ] Bluetooth or Network remote control (reduce vibration)
    * [ ] Alternative seekbar mode, improve accuracy within small range


## TODO

## Known Bugs (from oldest to newest)
+ [ ] The focus distance used for capture can not match the one used for request.  Seems to have hyper focal distance be the furthest focus distance.
+ [ ] The first capture in every capture request (both repeating and capture) will take more time than the exposure time.  The extended time depends on the previous capture's exposure time, usually triple of it.
+ [ ] If the capture format is JPEG, image can not be saved after called 'captureSession.abortCapture()'.
+ [ ] On `OnePlus 6 (enchilada)`, when the image format is RAW_SENSOR, the preview viewfinder will get anomalously brighter, but the captured image still have normal brightness.
+ [ ] On `OnePlus 6 (enchilada)`, when the image format is JPEG and the 'captureSize' is the max available value '4k x 3x', the edge of result image will be cut out.
+ [ ] When the image format is RAW_SENSOR, the 'captureSize' acquired from 'cameraCharacteristics' will be slightly bigger than then actual result.
+ [ ] On `OnePlus 6 (enchilada)`, after captured single image several times, the `imageReader` will suddenly not recceive the capture result.  This will not happen in `repeatingRequest` or after stopped the repeatingRequest of preview.
+ [x] ~Settings will not be initialized the first time opening the APP, needs to set at least once.~
+ [ ] When the Focus Assistant center was set to some point, the magnification will be smaller, even if the `CaptureResult.SCALER_CROP_REGION` is exactly what we want.
